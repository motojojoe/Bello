# Bello
This repository is a playground for exploring new ideas, techniques, and technologies in iOS development. Expect prototypes, quick experiments, and unconventional approaches using Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, and more. Code here is not production-ready — it’s meant for learning, testing, and pushing boundaries.

## Dependency Injection Example

The `Home` module demonstrates a simple use of **Swinject** for dependency injection. Launch the app and open the **Home** tab to see a greeting provided by a service resolved from a Swinject container.
